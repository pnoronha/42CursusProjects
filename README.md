## [libft](https://github.com/pnoronha/libft.git)

At this first project we need to build our own **C library** with some basic and functions easily found
in some C libraries, **BUT** we are forbbiden from use them, unless we recode the functions.   
Here we learn not only what the function returns, but how it works.
